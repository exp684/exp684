# exp684 â€” Ph.D. in Computer Science

I am a researcher and software engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focused on high-performance algorithm design and mathematical optimization. I build reliable, scalable optimization software and production-ready systems using C, C++, Python, and Java, and I routinely model and solve complex decision problems with industry-grade solvers such as Gurobi, CPLEX, and GAMS.

## Core Expertise
- Mathematical programming (MIP, LP, QP) and model formulation
- Solver interfacing & tuning (Gurobi, CPLEX, GAMS)
- Algorithm design: exact methods, heuristics, and hybrid approaches
- High-performance implementations in C/C++ (profiling, memory and cache-aware code)
- Python tooling for prototyping, benchmarking, and reproducibility
- Software engineering for research: testing, CI, and documentation


## Collaboration
Open to research collaborations.
