# exp684 — Ph.D. in Computer Science

I am a researcher and software engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focused on high-performance algorithm design and mathematical optimization. I build reliable, scalable optimization software and production-ready systems using C, C++, Python, and Java, and I routinely model and solve complex decision problems with industry-grade solvers such as Gurobi, CPLEX, and GAMS.

## Snapshot
- Role: Ph.D. in Computer Science (researcher / software engineer)
- Areas: Mathematical programming, mixed-integer optimization, scheduling, algorithmic optimization, performance engineering
- Languages & tech: C · C++ · Python · Java
- Solvers & modeling: Gurobi · CPLEX · GAMS
- Style: Robust, reproducible, production-oriented research and software

---

## Core Expertise
- Mathematical programming (MIP, LP, QP) and model formulation
- Solver interfacing & tuning (Gurobi, CPLEX, GAMS)
- Algorithm design: exact methods, heuristics, and hybrid approaches
- High-performance implementations in C/C++ (profiling, memory and cache-aware code)
- Python tooling for prototyping, benchmarking, and reproducibility
- Software engineering for research: testing, CI, and documentation

## Selected projects (examples — replace with your projects)
- High-performance Branch-and-Cut Framework (C++)
  - Custom branch-and-cut implementation with solver callbacks and parallel node processing. Integrates with Gurobi/CPLEX for primal heuristics and cuts. [link]
- Robust Resource Scheduling Suite (Python + Gurobi)
  - Parameterized models for rostering and resource allocation with scenario-based robustness and fast heuristics for real-time adjustments. [link]
- MIP Model Library (GAMS/CPLEX)
  - Reusable, well-documented formulations for classical scheduling and routing benchmarks, designed for easy experimentation and solver comparisons. [link]
- Benchmarking & Reproducibility Toolkit (Python)
  - End-to-end benchmarking harness (experiment config, runner, results database, plots) for solver and algorithm comparisons. [link]

## Publications & Talks
Available on request or via Google Scholar / ORCID. Example citation format you can use in README:

> exp684, "Title of Paper", Proceedings / Journal, Year. DOI: 10.xxxx/xxxxx

I can format a publications section (selected, full, or interactive) if you provide publication metadata or a Google Scholar / ORCID link.

## How I work
- Emphasis on reproducibility: scripts, seed control, and experiment manifests
- Prefer modular, well-tested code with clear interfaces to solvers
- Use benchmarking pipelines to compare solver settings, heuristics, and formulations
- Document assumptions and performance trade-offs for every experiment
